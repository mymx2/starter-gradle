# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this project! Before you start, You Should have at least a basic knowledge of how to use
GitHub. If
you don't, you'll find it helpful to read some of the articles in the documentation for repositories and pull requests
first. For example,
see [Quickstart for repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/quickstart-for-repositories), [About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches),
and [About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

## Development

### Setup

Clone this repo to your local machine and install the dependencies.

## Contributing

Please follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when contributing.

### Git Commit Message Convention

> This is adapted from [Angular's commit convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).

#### TL;DR:

Messages must be matched by the following regex:

```regexp
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|docs|dx|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|build|ci|chore|types|wip)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}/
```

#### Examples

Appears under "Features" header, `compiler` subheader:

```
feat(compiler): add 'comments' option
```

Appears under "Bug Fixes" header, `v-model` subheader, with a link to issue #28:

```
fix(v-model): handle events on blur

close #28
```

Appears under "Performance Improvements" header, and under "Breaking Changes" with the breaking change explanation:

```
perf(core): improve vdom diffing by removing 'foo' option

BREAKING CHANGE: The 'foo' option has been removed.
```

The following commit and commit `667ecc1` do not appear in the changelog if they are under the same release. If not, the
revert commit appears under the "Reverts" header.

```
revert: feat(compiler): add 'comments' option

This reverts commit 667ecc1654a317a13331b17617d973392f415f02.
```

### Full Message Format

A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**. The header has a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body, it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However, if there is any `BREAKING CHANGE`, the commit will always appear in the changelog.

Other prefixes are up to your discretion. Suggested prefixes are `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, and `test` for
non-changelog related tasks.

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example `core`, `compiler`, `ssr`, `v-model`, `transition` etc...

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit [**Close**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit
message is then used for this.

**Closed Issues** should be added at the end of the commit message (e.g. close #456, fix #123)

on committing.
